# Hi, i'm Tin

**Tech Entrepreneur | Building High-Performance Tools for E-commerce & Social Media Growth**

3 years in Python development, recently transitioning into DevOps. Currently focused on building and running 2 tech products of my own.

---

### Vision

Building products that are high-performance, stable, clean, and easy to maintain. I believe good software should just work — fast, reliable, and without unnecessary complexity.

### What I'm Working On

**SpySolution.vn** · CTO & Founder

Growth solutions for Shopee Affiliate & Livestream. Providing tools and strategies to optimize revenue from affiliate marketing and livestreaming on the Shopee platform.

Built a high-performance backend that processes 100K products in 3 seconds - roughly 20x faster than other tools on the market. Realtime cart-switching with latency under 1 second. System runs on 7 containers distributed across 3 servers with self-designed CI/CD and WebSocket realtime communication.

`100+ customers` · `3-4x revenue increase for livestream sellers` · `Fully automated, saving significant time for users`

**TinLikeSub.pro** · CEO & Founder

Marketing, seeding, and SEO services across multiple social media platforms. Serving needs for engagement growth and brand building on social media.

Full-stack Laravel application with a FastAPI server connected to 10 mini PCs and 200 devices for automation tasks.

`200+ users` · `50+ collaborators`

---

### Infrastructure & DevOps

Managing all infrastructure for both products. Running a dedicated server cluster, handling everything from deployment, CI/CD pipelines to inter-server connectivity and load balancing.

Currently deepening my DevOps skills — working with Kubernetes for orchestration, designing CI/CD workflows, and optimizing multi-server architectures in local network environments.

---

### Highlights

- Scaled system to handle 100K products in 3s, ~20x faster than competitors
- Built distributed system across 7 containers / 3 servers with custom inter-server communication
- Self-managed infrastructure: CI/CD, Kubernetes, load balancing, deployment automation
